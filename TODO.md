- [ ] Add lightweight synchronization around `g_keyboardInfo` / `g_hotkeyInfo` accesses (hook vs. timer/reg-change paths) to prevent iterator corruption/races without altering visible behavior. Bottlenecks: must not block the low-level hook; prefer short critical sections or pointer-swap to fresh copies; avoid any lock that spans `SendMessage`/`Reg*` calls.
- [ ] Rework hotkey injection helper thread: start it with `_beginthreadex` (real handle) and wake it via an event instead of `SuspendThread/ResumeThread`, keeping existing remap logic but avoiding stuck threads on Win10. Bottlenecks: need to replace all `SuspendThread`/`ResumeThread` sites; ensure thread waits on event without busy-loop; plan how/if to shut it down on exit to avoid handle leaks.
- [ ] Harden clipboard-based conversion: add retries/timeouts for `OpenClipboard`/`GetClipboardData`/`SetClipboardData`, null-check clipboard text, and bail early with a beep instead of blocking if the clipboard or target window is unresponsive. Bottlenecks: current `SendMessage` into foreign window can hang; `wcslen` on NULL crashes; retries must stay short to not stall repeated conversions.
